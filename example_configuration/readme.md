# Example Configuration

This folder contains some files and modules that show what you can do with this library.

## github_action_workflow.yml

Example for deploying and running a test on Databricks.

## databricks.yml

Example configuration that automatically uses the DAB configuration from the databricks deployment helper.

## default_configs.py

Example module with pre-customized models.

## tests

### test_bronze_silver_gold_jobs_generator.py

Pytest module for local execution. Tests the customized code from `ddh_config`

### databricks/integration

Pytest module for execution on Databricks (see github_action_workflow)

## bundle_pipelines

Deployment files for jobs and databricks jobs

### ddh_config

Customized models and helper methods for streamlined creation of bronze-silver-gold jobs (one task per layer) and ad-hoc jobs. Ad-hoc jobs are unscheduled jobs that only contain one task to overcome the limitation that you cannot run a single task from a job.

### jobs

Root folder of the job definitions

#### layer/example_job_name

Deployment.py contains the actual job definitions. The task_xxx subfolders contain the pipeline_runner.py, databricks_config.json and optionally additional files (that can be referenced in the deployment.py).

### dab_deployment_generated_by_ddh.yml

A deployment file for DAB deployments. This example was generated by the databricks deployment helper library on basis of the jobs defined in the example_configuration.
